We can comment in c in two way 

Single line comment

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
  // printf() is a statement 
  printf("Awesome !!!");
  return 0;
}
```

Multiline comment

``` c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() 
{
  /*
  you can write as much
  as you want inside
  of this comment 
  */
  printf("Yohohoho !!!");
  return 0;
}
```
