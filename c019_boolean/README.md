`bool` is a data type in C.It is also known as `boolean`.
In C, `bool` is not a built-in data type like `int` or `float` .It was introduced in c99.
In order to use `bool` we need to import the following header file .

``` c 
#include <stdbool.h>
```
> A boolean variable is declared with `bool` keyword .

``` c
bool isMale = true;
bool isPassed = true;
bool checked = false;
```
