A computer program is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer.

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called statements.


This statement print a simple text 
``` c
printf("Awesome !!");
```

Using ; after each statement is mandatory. 
``` c
printf("using semicolon is very important");
```

This is also a statement
``` c 
return 0;
```
